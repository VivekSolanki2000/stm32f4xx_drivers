# STM32f4xx_HAL_drivers

This project is a Hardware Abastraction Layer for the STM32F4xx Microcontroller. It makes use of the CMSIS Library for all the register definitions.

It Contains Polling and Interrupt Drivers for the following peripherals:




## Peripheral Supported

- GPIO
- SPI
- I2C
- UART

It also contains Libraries to:

Configure the system clock
To debounce a button using Polling and Interrupts
To interface with Keypad using Polling and Interrupts
To Configure the Systick :
To implement a Timeout Feature
To implement delay function
I have created this project as a learning process to understand the various peripherals and communication protocols at the register level.
